# This is an internal tool that I am building for the Alameda County Probation Department.

My first week as an intern with ACPD, I was tasked with tracking discrepancies between the goals listed on the website, 

https://probation.acgov.org/strategic-plan/goals-and-objectives.page

and goals listed on the quarterly reports. This clearly was going to take a lot of time, and my immediate reaction was to automate this using the BS4 and Pandas libraries in Python. 

The program can be split into three parts. 

Part 1 
Scrape the webpage, and extract its contents into an excel spreadshet. 

Part 2 
Aggregate all 4 quarterly reports into one excel spreadsheet. 

By now, you should have two spreadsheets. One with the contents of the website, and another with the contents of the quarterly reports. 

Part 3 
Algorithmically find discrepancies between the two. 
I am here.
